# Document Intelligence Suite

Welcome! üëã This is the Document Intelligence Suite, your one-stop solution for turning PDFs, images, and Word docs into searchable, structured data. I built it because‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know about you‚Äîbut wrestling with scattered invoices, reports, and scans drove me nuts. Now, everything gets ingested, parsed, chunked, and made queryable through a friendly API and dashboard.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

1. **Flexible Ingestion**: Drop in text-based PDFs, scanned images, and Word files via a FastAPI endpoint. No more manual copy-paste.
2. **Smart OCR & Parsing**: Scanned docs go through Tesseract (or PaddleOCR), while text-PDFs are handled by pdfplumber or PyMuPDF under the hood.
3. **Semantic Chunking**: We slice and dice content into meaningful sections, then generate embeddings using SentenceTransformers.
4. **Vector Store**: Embeddings live locally in a FAISS vector store today‚Äîand you can swap in Pinecone or Weaviate when you‚Äôre ready to scale.
5. **Interactive Q&A**: Fire up a chat endpoint that taps either a local LLM (LLaMA/Mistral via Ollama) or your OpenAI API key. Ask away!
6. **Structured Data Extraction**: Entities like names, dates, invoice numbers‚Äîpulled out via spaCy pipelines, with regex as a safety net.
7. **Multiple Output Formats**: Get your data as JSON, CSV/Excel, or push it out through REST callbacks.
8. **User Dashboard**: React + Tailwind gives you real-time upload status, extracted insights, and usage metrics in a sleek interface.
9. **Containerized & Cloud-Ready**: Docker for local dev, plus Kubernetes manifests and Terraform templates for spinning up in the cloud.

## üì¶ Docker Setup

The project uses Docker to containerize both the backend and frontend services.

### Backend Dockerfile

The backend Dockerfile is located at `/IDIS/backend/Dockerfile` and includes dependencies for FastAPI, Tesseract OCR, and other tools.

### Frontend Dockerfile

The frontend Dockerfile is located at `/IDIS/frontend/Dockerfile` and is configured to build and serve the React application using a lightweight Node.js image.

  ```bash
  curl -F "file=@/path/to/invoice.pdf" http://localhost:8000/upload
  ```

- **Chat Q&A**:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       -d '{"question":"What‚Äôs the total due on invoice #123?"}'
  ```
